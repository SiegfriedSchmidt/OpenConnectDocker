# Docker
This repository contains code from https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv

And you can easily run ocserv compiled with openssl library (ocserv:openssl) or gnutls (ocserv)  with docker

### Docker setup
Running docker engine is required

```bash
mkdir ocserv
cd ocserv
touch docker-compose.yml # <- copy docker-compose.yml
mkdir config
cd config
touch ocserv.conf # <- copy ocserv.conf
docker-compose up -d
```

### Create user
#### Password
```bash
docker exec -it ocserv ocpasswd -c /etc/ocserv/ocpasswd username
```

#### Certificate
```bash
docker exec -it ocserv gen-client-cert.sh username
```

### Network-manager
Usage: network-manager.sh <command>

Commands:

    enable-internet : Adds an iptables rule for VPN_SUBNET to enable internet access.

    disable-internet: Removes the iptables rule.
	
    status          : Displays current NAT rules for VPN_SUBNET.

```bash
docker exec -it ocserv network-manager.sh enable-internet
```

# About

The OpenConnect VPN server (ocserv) is an open source Linux SSL
VPN server designed for organizations that require a remote access
VPN with enterprise user management and control. It follows
the [openconnect protocol](https://gitlab.com/openconnect/protocol)
and is the counterpart of the [openconnect VPN client](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/).
It is also compatible with CISCO's AnyConnect SSL VPN.

The program consists of:
 1. ocserv, the main server application
 2. occtl, the server's control tool. A tool which allows one to query the
   server for information.
 3. ocpasswd, a tool to administer simple password files.


# Supported platforms

The OpenConnect VPN server is designed and tested to work, with both IPv6
and IPv4, on Linux systems. It is, however, known to work on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and other BSD derived systems.

Known limitation is that on platforms, which do not support procfs(5),
changes to the configuration must only be made while ocserv(8) is stopped.
Not doing so will cause new worker processes picking up the new
configuration while ocserv-main will use the previous configuration.

# Build instructions

To build from a distributed release use:

```
$ ./configure && make && make check
```

To test the code coverage of the test suite use the following:
```
$ ./configure --enable-code-coverage
$ make && make check && make code-coverage-capture
```

Note that the code coverage reported does not currently include tests which
are run within docker.

In addition to the prerequisites listed above, building from git requires
the following packages: autoconf, automake, and xz.

To build from the git repository use:
```
$ autoreconf -fvi
$ ./configure && make
```


# Basic installation instructions

Now you need to generate a certificate. E.g.
```
$ certtool --generate-privkey > ./test-key.pem
$ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey test-key.pem --outfile test-cert.pem
```
(make sure you enable encryption or signing)


Create a dedicated user and group for the server unprivileged processes
(e.g., 'ocserv'), and then edit the [sample.config](doc/sample.config)
and set these users on run-as-user and run-as-group options. The run:
```
# cd doc && ../src/ocserv -f -c sample.config
```

# Configuration

Several configuration instruction are available in [the recipes repository](https://gitlab.com/openconnect/recipes).


# Profiling

To identify the bottlenecks in software under certain loads
you can profile ocserv using the following command.
```
# perf record -g ocserv
```

After the server is terminated, the output is placed in perf.data.
You may examine the output using:
```
# perf report
```


# Continuous Integration (CI)

We use the gitlab-ci continuous integration system. It is used to test
most of the Linux systems (see .gitlab-ci.yml),and is split in two phases,
build image creation and compilation/test. The build image creation is done
at the openconnect/build-images subproject and uploads the image at the gitlab.com
container registry. The compilation/test phase is on every commit to project.
